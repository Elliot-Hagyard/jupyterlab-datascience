# jupyterlab-datascience

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Datascience Notebook with a few added packages for use in [CyVerse Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org)

Jupyter Lab Datascience image built from the [Datascience Notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook) for [CyVerse VICE](https://cyverse-visual-interactive-computing-environment.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html). Project Jupyter's base image requires a couple additional configuration files for it be compatible with CyVerse Kubernetes orchestration and iRODS data store.

# Instructions

## Run Docker locally or on a Virtual Machine

To run the JupyterLab, you must first `pull` from DockerHub, or activate a [CyVerse Account](https://user.cyverse.org/services/mine) and launch in the Discovery Environment VICE.

The container for running JupyterLab is hosted on DockerHub and can be started locally:


```
docker pull harbor.cyverse.org/vice/jupyter/datascience:latest
```

```
docker run -it --rm -d harbor.cyverse.org/vice/jupyter/datascience:latest
```

## Run Docker container in CyVerse VICE

Unless you plan on making changes to this container, you should just use the existing launch button above.

You can build a new Docker container with additional dependencies from this Docker Hub image by using the `FROM cyversevice/jupyterlab-scipy:latest` at the beginning of your own Dockerfile.

## Developer notes

To test the container locally:

```
docker run -it --rm -v /$HOME:/work --workdir /work -p 8888:8888 -e REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8888 harbor.cyverse.org/vice/jupyter/datascience:latest
```

To build your own container with a Dockerfile and additional dependencies, pull the pre-built image from DockerHub:

```
FROM harbor.cyverse.org/vice/jupyter/datascience:latest
```

Follow the instructions in the [VICE manual for integrating your own tools and apps](https://cyverse-visual-interactive-computing-environment.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/developer_guide/building.html).
